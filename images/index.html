       <p> Conducted 5 user interviews including participants who are/were university students, people who had immigrated to the country from overseas, and people in our lives who we knew had gone through financially difficult situations. Any of us could fall into an unexpected situation that requires us to seek food assistance.After we collected our responses to our user interviews, we placed the responses into an affinity diagram, grouping them into sections like emotions felt during times of need, advice respondents have given to others who have needed help, relief resources they were aware of, and food waste management strategies. </p>

                <p class="lead my-4">
                7.6 million tonnes of food is wasted across the supply and consumption pipeline, and this wastage equals about 312kg per person, each year. Hunger is also a hidden but very real problem in Australia.
                The vast majority of people in need of food, experience feelings of shame and embarrassment if they reach the point where they need to seek help. One in three people struggling to meet their food needs are new to the situation.
                our team is creating a mobile app that will attempt to redistribute food from the supply chain (grocery stores, suppliers, individuals and restaurants), that would otherwise go waste to those who need it the most while maintaining anonymity and autonomy by using a food locker.

        <h1><span class="text-warning"> Value Proposition</span></h1>
        <p> Many organisations are already doing wonderful things like connecting those who need food assistance with sources of food. However, we noticed there was a gap in connecting the individual directly to the food source, especially in an anonymous way. Often individuals would have to visit third party locations like charities or apply through a system to receive assistance. 
        That is why we wanted to create a product that allows the user to register their details, put in their dietary requirements, be given a locker, locker code and a location, and be able to collect food efficiently, easily and with no questions asked. We don’t always know what people’s stories are and sometimes it is better to just reach out an arm of grace and understanding rather than seeking all the answers.

        <p> We wanted to create as easy of a user flow as possible as we understand that our users will probably be looking for a simple way to assess food assistance and the user may be turned away if there is too much information collection or if the process is clunky. We wanted to create a stress-free and shame free user journey for those who find themselves in a vulnerable situation.
